# 🌐 Pranjal Pandey — Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted with **GitHub Pages** at
👉 [https://pranjalpandey-9645.github.io](https://pranjalpandey-9645.github.io)

The site is a simple, static HTML/CSS project that introduces who I am, what I’m learning, and will eventually showcase the projects I build as I grow my skills in **C programming** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

## 📖 About

I’m currently focused on:
- Building a strong foundation in **C programming**
- Exploring **data structures** like arrays, linked lists, and queues
- Practicing **algorithmic problem-solving** (binary search, subarray problems, etc.)
- Learning developer workflows with **VS Code, Git, and GitHub**

This portfolio is a **work in progress** — right now it highlights my journey and skills, and will expand with real projects soon.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — structure
- **CSS3** — styling and layout
